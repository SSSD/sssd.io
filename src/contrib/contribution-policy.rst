Contribution policy
===================

There are many ways you can contribute to the System Security Services Daemon.

SSSD development discussions occur either on:

- SSSD GitHub project `issues <https://github.com/sssd/sssd/issues>`_

- SSSD development mailing list
  (`sssd-devel <https://lists.fedorahosted.org/archives/list/sssd-devel@lists.fedorahosted.org/>`_)

- #sssd `IRC channel <irc://irc.freenode.net/sssd>`_ on
  `freenode <http://freenode.net/>`_.

Keep in mind that SSSD developers are spread across different time zones.
Mailing list is a preferred communication channel if you wish to reach the entire team.

The SSSD originated as a sister-project to `FreeIPA <http://www.freeipa.org/>`_,
so we share many pieces. Contributing to FreeIPA may also help SSSD and vice versa.

If you want to file a bug or enhancement request please use SSSD GitHub
`issue <https://github.com/sssd/sssd/issues>`_ tracking system.

Licensing
---------

All source code committed to the SSSD is assumed to be made available under
the GPLv3+ license unless the submitter specifies another license at that time.
The upstream SSSD maintainers reserve the right to refuse a submission
if the license is deemed incompatible with the goals of the project.

Tasks for newcomers
-------------------

We try to mark tickets that donâ€™t require too much existing knowledge with
the ``Easy to fix`` keyword in our issue tracker. We also prepared a
`query <https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Easy+to+fix%22>`_
that lists the easy fixes. Before starting the work on any of these tickets,
it might be a good idea to contact the SSSD developers on the
`sssd-devel <https://sssd.io/docs/developers/contribute.html#contribute>`_
mailing list and check if the ticket is still valid or ask for guidance in general.
