List of Design Pages
####################

The following is a list of design pages that describe decision process and
implementation details of more complex changes. Each page provides a solution
overview to help you understand how the change was implemented. It does not
serve as an accurate documentation of the change. The changes landed in
different versions of SSSD and not all of them were implemented.

.. warning::

    Each design page was used to describe the initial implementation of the
    change. However, the state of those documents do not necessarily correspond
    to the current state of the project since we do not keep these documents up
    to date with further changes and bug fixes.
